## Introduction

> The client for this week's challenge is Gokada - the largest last mile delivery service in Nigeria. Gokada works is partnered with motorbike owners and drivers to deliver parcels across Lagos, Nigeria. Gokada has completed more than a million deliveries in less than a year, with a fleet of over 1200 riders.
One key issue Gokada has faced as it expands its service is the sub-optimal placement of pilots (Gokada calls their motor drivers pilots) and clients who want to use Gokada to send their parcel. This has led to a high number of unfulfilled delivery requests.
